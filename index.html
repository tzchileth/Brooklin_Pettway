            <p>Hi, I am <span class="name"></span>. A beautiful girl from Birmingham, AL.
                I come from a family of 1 boy, 2 girls, and 1 female dog.
                My family is quite cool, but my siblings are too introverted.
                They eat, sleep, work, and keep to themselves.
                But I'm kind of different. I'm the smartest.
